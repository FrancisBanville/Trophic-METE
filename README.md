# Trophic-METE

In this paper, we use the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) to derive expected distributions of food-web measures based solely on their total number of species. This work builds on the maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) of Harte and colleagues (2008), and on the flexible links model of MacDonald and colleagues (2020).
